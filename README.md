# Portfolio
## Hello, this is my personal portfolio
I created this website using ReactJS. I used few react libraries like react router dom, react icons, splideJS, framer motion. \
I used react router dom for the routing, with links and hashlinks. React icons for the icons like linkedIN, GitHub... SplideJS for the carousells on my recipeApp website. Framer motions for the animations on the navbar on the mobile version.
